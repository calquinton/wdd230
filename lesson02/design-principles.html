        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

        <p>Hick's law states that the time required to reach a decision increases logarithmically with the number of
            choices. In other words, the more choices one is presented with, the longer they will take to reach a
            decision. In web and UX design, then, it is important to minimize the choices a user is presented with so
            that they don't feel overwhelmed. Google does this exceptionally well; as you can see on the google home
            page, users are basically presented with one choice: google search.</p>

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>The New Yorker</p>

        <p>White space, or negative space, is the empty space around the content of a design or web page. Its use
            organizes the web page and makes the design more clean and aesthetically pleasing for the user by preventing
            it from feeling cluttered. I feel the New Yorker's website exemplifies this principle. The white space
            around the header, for example, calls attention to the title, and sufficient space is provided in between
            articles to allow them to feel like separate entities on the page.</p>

        <h3>PARC Contrast</h3>
        <p>Apple</p>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">https://www.apple.com/</a>
        <img src="../images/apples-home-page.png" alt="Apple's Home Page" width="400">
        <p>Contrast is the difference in color between two elements on a page. For web design, this usually means the
            lightness and darkness of colors. Contrast is important from an accessibility standpoint for text on a page
            because a high level of contrast between text and its background makes the text easier to read. Contrast is
            also important to draw attention to separate elements on a page. Apple's use of white text on a black
            background and black text on a white background makes the text as readable as possible. The use of black and
            white backgrounds for different sections also works to strikingly differentiate those sections.</p>
